### **Project Title**: **Online Learning Platform  ByteRise(MERN Stack)**  

---

### **Project Overview**:  
This project aims to develop a scalable and interactive online learning platform using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The application will allow users to browse courses, enroll in classes, and access learning materials. It will include essential features like user authentication, course recommendations, a progress tracker, and an admin dashboard for managing courses, instructors, and user accounts.

### **Key Objectives**:  
1. **Backend**:  
   - Develop a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js for handling user data, course management, and integration with third-party services like video hosting or email notifications.  
2. **Frontend**:  
   - Create a responsive, intuitive user interface using React.js, ensuring accessibility across devices.  
3. **Database**:  
   - Use MongoDB to manage data, including user profiles, course catalogs, enrollment data, and progress tracking.  
4. **Authentication**:  
   - Implement secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with role-based access for students, instructors, and administrators.  
5. **Deployment**:  
   - Deploy a production-ready application using platforms like AWS, Heroku, or Vercel for backend and frontend hosting.

### **Planned Features**:  
1. **User Features**:  
   - User registration and login.  
   - Browse and search for courses with dynamic filtering (e.g., by category, difficulty, instructor).  
   - Course details page with instructor information and video previews.  
   - Enroll in free or paid courses using secure payment integration.  
   - Track learning progress with progress bars and quizzes.  
   - Download resources (e.g., PDFs, presentations).  

2. **Instructor Features**:  
   - Instructor dashboard to create, edit, and manage courses.  
   - Upload course videos, descriptions, and resources.  
   - Track enrollment statistics and user feedback.  

3. **Admin Features**:  
   - Admin panel to manage user accounts, courses, and instructors.  
   - Review and approve courses submitted by instructors.  
   - View platform statistics (e.g., number of users, popular courses).  

4. **Optional Features**:  
   - Recommendation engine to suggest courses based on user preferences or learning history.  
   - Real-time Q&A for students to interact with instructors.  
   - Certification generation upon course completion.

### **Development Workflow**:  
1. **Agile Methodology**:  
   - Use iterative sprints to prioritize and deliver features.  
2. **Version Control**:  
   - Maintain code quality and collaboration using GitHub.  
3. **Testing**:  
   - Ensure robust functionality through unit and integration testing.

### **Milestone 1: Project Overview**  
#### **Objective**: Lay the foundation for the learning platform by setting up the development environment, project structure, and basic functionality for the backend and frontend.  

---

#### **Key Deliverables**:  
1. **Requirement Analysis**:  
   - Define core features such as authentication, course catalog, and enrollment system.  
2. **Environment Setup**:  
   - Initialize backend (Node.js/Express) and frontend (React.js) repositories.  
   - Configure dependencies and set up Git for version control.  
3. **Backend**:  
   - Create a basic Express server, connect to MongoDB, and set up a RESTful API structure.  
4. **Frontend**:  
   - Set up a React app with routing, a landing page, and basic UI components.  
5. **Documentation**:  
   - Provide a README file with project goals, setup instructions, and API endpoints.  

---

### **Success Criteria**:  
- Functional backend connected to MongoDB with basic API endpoints for users and courses.  
- Basic frontend with routing and UI design for the homepage and login/register pages.  
- Initial deployment for testing backend and frontend functionality.
